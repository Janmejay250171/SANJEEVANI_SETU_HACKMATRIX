Here on screen, we upload a policy or pick a demo contract like Star Health. Our AI extracts sum insured, room limits, and copays, complete with source snippets from the document. Once confirmed, we search over 54,000 hospitals in seconds. Notice our Policy Fit Score: it evaluates coverage fit, cost fit, institutional stature, and copay predictability. When we click 'Bill Breakdown', our engine shows the itemized procedure cost, room tariff, and warns the patient that a Single AC room will trigger a proportionate deduction penalty, advising them that switching to Twin Sharing saves ₹36,000. Finally, our Care Journey guidance follows them into the ward, alerting them to pre-auth windows and discharge checklists. It's comprehensive, transparent decision support for precision healthcare."),
